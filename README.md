Recently, somebody (Michael) from a Math server proposed an interesting set of integers - where in each integer's substrings are primes. He had analyzed the sequence till base 12, and asked one of my friend (Zairus) to create a code to analyze it in any base. Soon I joined in and completed the code.
Zairus and I settled on the name "Sliceprimes". This is the same sequence as the  OEIS sequence A085823 https://oeis.org/A085823.
The usage of this code is quite intuitive. First the base is taken as input and the Sliceprimes in the sequence are listed.
