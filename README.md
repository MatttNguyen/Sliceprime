In a math server, a friend of mine (Michael) proposed this problem. In this sequence (https://oeis.org/A085823), there is a finite amount of primes that all substrings are primes too (which we decided to call sliceprimes, hence the name). He conjectured that in any arbitrary base, there is always a finite amount of sliceprimes (yes, computing isn't a solution but it's still fun though). He tried to make a program to find it, but neither of them knew how to write code (and that's where I comes in).
